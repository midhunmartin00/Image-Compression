The project uses K means algorithm and principal component analysis algorithm .
If you are not already familiar with machine learning,
k means is a type of unsuprevised learning algorithm or in general it is a clustering algorithm i.e, the algorithm tries to find clusters in the data set provided.

There are mainly two iterative steps in the algorithm:
a) Assignment step- Each data point is assigned to a cluster whose center is nearest to it.
b) Update step- New cluster centers (centroids) are calculated from the data points assigned to the new cluster by choosing the average value of these data points.

Thus K-means clustering will group similar colors together into ‘k’ clusters.Therefore, each cluster centroid is the representative of the three dimensional color vector in RGB color space of its respective cluster.
